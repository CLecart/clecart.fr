            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project was to create a browser-based **Bomberman** game using only **JavaScript**, **DOM**, and **HTML**, with an emphasis on smooth performance and a 60 FPS target. The game runs smoothly without frame drops and includes key features such as smooth controls, dynamic score tracking, and a pause/restart functionality.</p>

            <h3>Core Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>60 FPS Consistency:</strong> The game ensures a smooth animation and consistent 60 FPS throughout the gameplay using the <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> API.</li>
                <li><strong>Controls:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Smooth, responsive keyboard controls that allow players to move and place bombs without delays or jank.</li>
                        <li>Continuous actions when keys are held down and stopping immediately once the key is released.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Pause Menu:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users can pause the game at any time and have the option to resume or restart the game.</li>
                        <li>The game continues to run at 60 FPS even when paused, without frame drops.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scoreboard:</strong> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Displays current score (XP or points) during gameplay.</li>
                        <li>Shows the player's remaining lives and a countdown timer until the game ends.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Technical Details:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Game Logic:</strong> Built using plain JavaScript to handle player movement, bomb placement, collision detection, and game state management.</li>
                <li><strong>Rendering Optimization:</strong> Focused on minimal layering to ensure the game runs smoothly at 60 FPS, avoiding unnecessary render layers that could affect performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Loop:</strong> Created an efficient game loop using <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> for smooth and consistent frame updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Measurement:</strong> Used browser developer tools to monitor FPS and frame rendering times to ensure no frame drops during gameplay.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Learning Outcomes and Skills Demonstrated:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>JavaScript Proficiency:</strong> Enhanced my JavaScript skills by implementing the game engine, handling animations, and managing game state and interactions.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Learned how to optimize performance in JavaScript, ensuring consistent FPS and smooth gameplay by leveraging <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Event-Driven Programming:</strong> Implemented asynchronous event handling for actions like keyboard inputs, game state transitions, and UI updates.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Design:</strong> Gained insights into game logic and mechanics, such as collision detection, player input handling, and implementing pause/resume functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Browser Developer Tools:</strong> Used developer tools to analyze performance, monitor FPS, and identify bottlenecks in rendering.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges Addressed:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring that the game maintained a steady 60 FPS without dropping frames, even during intense gameplay.</li>
                <li>Designing the pause menu so that it didnâ€™t impact performance and allowed for seamless resumption or restart.</li>
                <li>Managing smooth controls for player input, ensuring that key press events were registered without lag or jank.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why It Stands Out:</h3>
            <p>The Bomberman game stands out for its smooth performance and polished user experience. The focus on maintaining a consistent 60 FPS while ensuring smooth and responsive controls showcases the ability to build performance-intensive applications using just JavaScript and DOM manipulation. The pause and restart features, along with the well-organized scoreboard, make this project both fun and functional.</p>
